# Jojo's Card Game

This is a memory card game created with create-react-app using functional components.
This is an educational project, it is a part of the react section of the odin project fullstack curriculum.
I use functional components to create the app component as well as a card component that displays each of our cards stored in the state of
the Main component.

## Resources that I have used while creating this project:

-**Colors** : Customizing Colors Tailwind CSS **https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors**.

-**Font** : Fonts Monster Jojo font **https://fontsmonster.com/jojo-font/**.

-**Card Images**: The Jojo wikipedia **https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Egypt_9_Glory_Gods**.
